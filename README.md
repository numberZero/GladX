# GladX — GLAD for C++

As the name suggests, this project is inspired by [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad), although doesn’t use any code from it. GLAD generates straightforward OpenGL bindings for several languages, but it doesn’t and cannot make any use of the extra information present in the specifications, that maps nicely to modern C++ features. So GladX is an attempt to make true C++ bindings, handy and reliable.
